![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/MpFkXKD/LOGO-1.jpg)

## This project was made during our OOP course at Ariel University in the Department of Computer Science, 2021.

### Project site: https://github.com/ElhaiMansbach/OOP_Ex3.git

### Made by :student:	: Elhai Mansbach & Lioz Akirav.

The results of the data analysis can be viewed on the Wiki page [Wiki](https://github.com/Lioo7/OOP_Ex3-Implementing-NetworkX-library/wiki)

**This project is about implementing data structure and algorithms in a weighted directed graph accompanied by different graph algorithms in Python.<br/>
We used two interfaces to implement the graph properties and we implemented the graph in three classes.<br/>**

## Data Structures:

### NodeData:<br/>
This class represents the set of operations applied to a node in a directed weighted graph.<br/>
Each node has a unique key plus four additional node fields (weight, position, tag, and information) that were used only during the algorithms.<br/>

### DiGraph:<br/>
*The GraphInterface interface is implemented in DiGraph class:*<br/>
This class represents a directional weighted graph.<br/>
It supports over 10^6 vertices, with an average degree of 10.<br/>
The nodes and the edges are implemented in a data structure â€“ Dictionary.<br/>
The class includes these functions:
| function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| v_size |  Returns the number of vertices in this graph |
| e_size | Returns the number of edges in this graph |
| get_all_v | Returns a dictionary of all the nodes in the graph |
| all_in_edges_of_node | Returns a dictionary of all the nodes connected to the given node_id |
| all_out_edges_of_node | Returns a dictionary of all the nodes connected from the given node_id |
| get_mc | Returns the number of changes made in the graph |
| add_edge | Adds an edge to the graph |
| add_node | Adds a node to the graph |
| get_node | Gets a node's key and returns the NodeData |
| remove_node | Removes a node from the graph |
| remove_edge | Removes an edge from the graph |



### GraphAlgo:<br/>
*The GraphAlgoInterface interface is implemented in GraphAlgo class:*<br/>
The Graph_Algo object contains a graph to activate the algorithms on.<br/>

**This class represents the Graph Theory algorithms including these functions:**<br/>
| function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| __init__ | Initialize the graphh |
| get_graph | Returns the underlying graph of which this class works |
| shortest_path | Returns the shortest path and distance from node id1 to node id2. |
| connected_component | Finds the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) that node id1 is a part of |
| connected_components | Finds all the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) in the graph |
| save_to_json | Saves this weighted directed graph to the given file name - in JSON format |
| load_from_json | Loads the graph from the file |
| plot_graph | Plots the graph |


**This class also include these private functions:**<br/>
| function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| clear | PClears the graph and initializes all the nodes in the graph to their default values |
| dijkstra | Algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph |
| shortest_path_distance | Returns the shortest distance between two given nodes |
| is_numeric | The method gets a string and checks if its contains a number |


## Algorithms:
 ## BFS Algorithm
 * The Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
   tree or graph data structures. It starts at the given node in the graph,
   and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on
   to the nodes at the next depth level.
 * Complexity: O(|V|+|E|).
 
  ## Dijkstra Algorithm
  * A famous algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted positive graph.
  *  The algorithm put the given vertex in the priority queue, priority queue sort the vertices by they tag value.
     For each vertex we sum the current vertex's tag with his connected edge's weight.
     Each time we poll vertex with the minimal value in the priority queue,
     go over all its neighbors, select the neighbor with the minimal value and put it in the priority queue
     mark all the vertex we passed.
     If there is a path with a minimal weight we will discover it and select this path
     each vertex we finished passing out of the priority queue.
  * Complexity: O(|E|log|V| + |V|).

## Tests:

| test_GraphAlgo | Testing GraphAlgo class's functions |
